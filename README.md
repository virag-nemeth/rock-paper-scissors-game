Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Description

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed as my first project to learn and practice the basics of Python. The player competes against the computer by choosing between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, with the game determining the winner based on the standard rules of the game. This project helped me get familiar with core Python concepts such as conditionals, loops, and input handling.

How to Play
- Run the program
- Choose Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2)
- The computer randomly selects its choice, and the game will display the winner of the round
- You can play multiple rounds and keep track of the score

Technologies Used
- Python

Future Improvements
- Adding graphical user interface (GUI).
- Introducing more advanced features like different levels of difficulty.
- Tracking the player's win/loss ratio over multiple sessions.

Evaluation

I’m very excited about this project, as it’s my first Python project built from scratch. While it’s far from perfect, it marks an important milestone in my learning journey. I look forward to improving my skills and creating more complex and interesting projects in the future.
